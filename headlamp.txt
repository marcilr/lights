One idea is to create a new light headlamp.

The Fenix 18650 lights are a bit heavy for bicycling.


Features
========
o LED to use?
o White LED light
o Red LED light (?)
o Other color LED lights (???)
o low/media/high light levels
o IPX6 water proof
o Recharging via inductive charging,
  i.e. Qi wireless charging used by phones
o Recharging via waterproof usb port


IPX6 & IPX7
===========
IPX6 Waterproof Standard
Heavy splashing and rain - This test sends water at all angles through a
12.5mm nozzle at a rate of 100 liters/min at a pressure of 100kN/m2 for
3 minutes from a distance of 3 meters.  Must not fail or show water seepage.

IPX-7 Waterproof Standard
Puddle, stream, beer cooler and splash rated - Protected against water
immersion - Immersion for 30 minutes at a depth of 1 meter.

Interesting that IPX6 does not cover immersion.  Must be IPX7 for this.

Inductive charging
==================
Inductive charging (also known as wireless charging or cordless charging)
uses an electromagnetic field to transfer energy between two objects through
electromagnetic induction.  This is usually done with a charging station.
Energy is sent through an inductive coupling to an electrical device, which
can then use that energy to charge batteries or run the device.
