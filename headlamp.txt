One idea is to create a new light headlamp.

The Fenix 18650 lights are a bit heavy for bicycling.


Features
========
o LED to use?
  Cree XM-L2 U2 neutral white LED with a lifespan of 50,000 hours
  --www.fenix-store.com/fenix-hl55-led-headlamp/

o White LED light
o Red LED light (?)
o Other color LED lights (???)
o low/media/high light levels

o light levels:
  Four modes of output plus a "Burst" mode
  High:  420 Lumens (3 hours 45 min.)
  Mid:  165 Lumens (10 hours)
  Low:  55 Lumens (30 hours)
  Eco:  10 Lumens (150 hours)
  BURST:  900 Lumens

o Regulated
  Digitally regulated output maintains constant brightness
  --www.fenix-store.com/fenix-hl55-led-headlamp/

o Lens cover
  Toughened ultra-clear glass lens with anti-reflective coating
  --www.fenix-store.com/fenix-hl55-led-headlamp/

o Housing
  All-metal housing to shed heat and impact
  Premium Type III hard-anodized anti-abrasive finish
  --www.fenix-store.com/fenix-hl55-led-headlamp/


o IPX6 water proof
  The Fenix HL55 LED Headlamp is rated:
  Waterproof to IPX-8 standards (under water 6.5 feet/2 meters for 30 minutes)

o Batteries
  I think a rechargable 18650 Li-ion is a bit heavy for a bicycling headlamp
  Perhaps a 700mAh 16340 (3.7V, 17.4g/0.6oz, 34.5mm x 17mm)
  Li-ion, same diameter as 18650 (65.2mm x 18.6mm)

  I do like the Petzl - ACCU CORE Rechargeable Battery for Use with
  Compact Lamps, $29 (amazon prime - Oct 5, 2017)

o Recharging via inductive charging,
  i.e. Qi wireless charging used by phones

o Recharging via waterproof usb port

o red/grean charging/charged indicator light.
o charge level indicator light or 3 LEDs?

o Reverse polarity protection guards against improper battery installation


IPX6 & IPX7
===========
IPX6 Waterproof Standard
  Heavy splashing and rain - This test sends water at all angles through a
  12.5mm nozzle at a rate of 100 liters/min at a pressure of 100kN/m2 for
  3 minutes from a distance of 3 meters.  Must not fail or show water seepage.
  --gpslodge.com/

IPX-7 Waterproof Standard
  Puddle, stream, beer cooler and splash rated - Protected against water
  immersion - Immersion for 30 minutes at a depth of 1 meter.
  --gpslodge.com/

IPX-8 Waterproof Standard
  Standards (under water 6.5 feet/2 meters for 30 minutes)
  --fenix-store.com/

Interesting that IPX6 does not cover immersion.  Must be IPX7 for this.

Inductive charging
==================
Inductive charging (also known as wireless charging or cordless charging)
uses an electromagnetic field to transfer energy between two objects through
electromagnetic induction.  This is usually done with a charging station.
Energy is sent through an inductive coupling to an electrical device, which
can then use that energy to charge batteries or run the device.
